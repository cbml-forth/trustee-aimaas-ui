# AIMaaS-UI

AI Model as a Service (AIMaaS) aims to simplify the onboarding process for various AI models, empowering TRUSTEE to enhance and expand its current AI
infrastructure hosted in the cloud. AIMaaS-UI features a similar graphical interface as the DA, but for AI purposes (training or inference). It allows the graphical input of specific computations to be executed (for example, considered aggregation for models, considered model providers...) and the graphical output of the obtained aggregated result
